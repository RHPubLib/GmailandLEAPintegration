# Polaris Patron Check for Gmail

A privacy-safe patron verification tool for public libraries using **Polaris ILS** and **Google Workspace**. When staff open an email from a known patron, a sidebar card appears in Gmail showing the patron's account type and a one-click deep-link to their Polaris LEAP record.

## Why We Built This

Staff regularly receive emails from patrons and need to quickly understand who they're speaking with — full cardholder, digital-only account, or restricted card — without manually looking them up in LEAP.

We originally explored Sublime Security banners embedded in email subjects, but discovered a critical privacy problem: **banners embedded in email bodies travel with forwards and replies**, potentially exposing patron status to unintended recipients.

This tool solves that with a **Gmail Add-on sidebar card** — it appears only in the reading staff member's Gmail view and is never part of the email body. It cannot be forwarded. Discussed at IUG and built with direct input from Google engineers at Google Cloud Next 2026.

## How It Works

```
Polaris SQL Server
        ↓  nightly (SSRS subscriptions, staggered)
SSRS Reports (3 patron groups)
  Each report emails a 2-column CSV to a dedicated Gmail inbox
  Columns: EmailAddress, PatronID
        ↓  nightly (systemd timer or cron, after SSRS completes)
patron_sync.py on Linux server
  • Reads Gmail via IMAP, extracts CSV attachments
  • Normalizes emails, builds LEAP deep-link URLs
  • Cross-list dedup: Full > Digital > Restricted
    (shared/family emails assigned to highest-priority group only)
  • Writes to Google Sheet (3 tabs)
  • Deletes processed report emails from inbox
        ↓
Google Sheet (3 tabs, written by service account)
  Full         → full cardholders + LEAP URLs
  Digital Card → digital/eContent accounts + LEAP URLs
  Restricted   → restricted/limited accounts + LEAP URLs
        ↓
Gmail Add-on (Google Workspace Marketplace, private)
  Admin force-installed for staff OUs — no permission prompts
  Reads Sheet on each email open, shows sidebar card
```

## What Staff See

When a staff member opens an email from a known patron:

- **Patron type badge** — VERIFIED PATRON / DIGITAL CARD HOLDER / RESTRICTED CARD
- **Status and access level** — plain-language description
- **Open in LEAP button** — one click opens the patron's record in Polaris LEAP

If the sender is not in the patron database, the card shows "Not a known patron."

## Prerequisites

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Polaris ILS | SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) required |
| Google Workspace | Business/Education — Admin Console access needed |
| Linux server | For nightly sync script |
| Dedicated Gmail account | Receives SSRS report emails via subscription |
| GCP project | Linked to your Google Workspace domain |

---

## Setup

### 1. Polaris SSRS Reports

Create three reports in SSRS. SQL queries are in [`ssrs-queries/`](ssrs-queries/). **Before using them:**

- Replace `%@yourdomain.org` with your staff email domain
- Replace `PatronCodeID IN (...)` with your library's patron code IDs for each group

For each report, configure a **nightly subscription**:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Render format | CSV (comma delimited) |
| Delivery | Email to your dedicated Gmail address |
| Subject | Unique subject per report — must match `.env` exactly |
| Include report | Yes (attached as `.csv`) |
| Schedule | Stagger 5 min apart; complete before sync script runs |

> The report table layout must have **two columns**: `[EmailAddress]` and `[PatronID]`. A single-column report will sync emails but produce no LEAP URLs.

### 2. Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet with three tabs named **exactly**:
- `Full`
- `Digital Card`
- `Restricted`

Note the Sheet ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/**SHEET_ID**/edit`

### 3. GCP Service Account

1. [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) → **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create**
2. Download a JSON key for the service account
3. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email address as **Editor**
4. Store the JSON key on your server (keep it out of version control — it's in `.gitignore`)

### 4. Sync Script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RHPubLib/polaris-patron-check.git
cd polaris-patron-check
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```env
GMAIL_ADDRESS=patron-sync@yourdomain.org
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=<Gmail app password>
STAFF_EMAIL_DOMAIN=yourdomain.org

SSRS_SUBJECT_FULL=<subject of your Full report subscription email>
SSRS_SUBJECT_DIGITAL=<subject of your Digital report subscription email>
SSRS_SUBJECT_LIMITED=<subject of your Limited report subscription email>

GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=/path/to/service-account-key.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=<Sheet ID from the URL>
```

Test manually:
```bash
python3 patron_sync.py
```

Successful output looks like:
```
INFO Polaris → Google Sheet sync started
INFO Subject "...": found 1 email(s) — using most recent
INFO   CSV sample row: ['patron@example.com', '12345']  →  leap_url='https://...'
INFO Sheet tab "Full": wrote 43,902 rows (43902 with LEAP URLs)
INFO Sync completed successfully
```

Schedule nightly. On systemd/immutable systems:
```bash
sudo cp systemd/patron-sync.service systemd/patron-sync.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now patron-sync.timer
```

Or via cron:
```bash
bash setup_cron.sh
```

### 5. Gmail Add-on

1. [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) → **New project**
2. Replace `Code.gs` with [`gmail-addon/Code.gs`](gmail-addon/Code.gs)
3. Replace `appsscript.json` with [`gmail-addon/appsscript.json`](gmail-addon/appsscript.json)
4. **Project Settings → Script Properties → Add property:**
   - Key: `SHEET_ID` / Value: your Google Sheet ID
5. Update the `logoUrl` in `appsscript.json` and `buildHeader()` in `Code.gs` to point to your library's icon
6. **Deploy → New deployment → Add-on** → Deploy → copy the Deployment ID

### 6. Publish to Google Workspace Marketplace (Private)

1. GCP Console → **APIs & Services → Library** → enable **Google Workspace Marketplace SDK**
2. **Marketplace SDK → App Configuration:**
   - App Visibility: **Private** *(cannot be changed after saving)*
   - Installation Settings: **Admin Only Install**
   - App Integrations: **Google Workspace add-on → Apps Script** → paste Deployment ID
   - OAuth scopes:
     ```
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
     ```
3. **Store Listing tab** — fill in name, description, category, icons, screenshot, support links → Save Draft → **Publish**

### 7. Force-Install via Admin Console

1. [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) → **Apps → Google Workspace Marketplace apps**
2. Select your staff OU in the left sidebar → **Install App**
3. Find your private app → **Admin install** → Continue
4. Select specific OUs → Select → **Finish**

Staff will have the add-on appear automatically in Gmail within 24 hours — no permission prompts.

## Customizing Patron Groups

Edit the `LISTS` array in `patron_sync.py` and the `PATRON_TYPES` object in `Code.gs` to match your library's patron codes. You can use fewer or more groups — the Sheet tab names and SSRS subject lines just need to match across all three files.

The priority order (Full > Digital > Restricted) means a patron email that appears in multiple groups is assigned only to the highest-priority group in the Sheet.

## File Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `patron_sync.py` | Nightly sync script |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.env.template` | Credential template (copy to `.env`, never commit `.env`) |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes secrets, key file, logs |
| `setup_cron.sh` | Register cron job (Linux) |
| `setup_task_scheduler.ps1` | Register scheduled task (Windows) |
| `systemd/` | systemd service + timer for immutable/bootc systems |
| `ssrs-queries/` | Parameterized SQL for the three SSRS reports |
| `gmail-addon/Code.gs` | Gmail Add-on source |
| `gmail-addon/appsscript.json` | Add-on manifest |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `No email found with subject "..."` | Subject mismatch or subscription hasn't run | Verify subject in `.env` matches SSRS subscription exactly |
| Email found but no CSV attachment | Wrong render format | Set SSRS render format to "CSV (comma delimited)" |
| `0 with LEAP URLs` in log | Report table missing PatronID column | Add `[PatronID]` column to Report Builder table layout |
| Add-on shows "Permission required" | Installed individually, not via Admin Console | Remove user install; deploy via Admin Console instead |
| Add-on doesn't appear for staff | Propagation delay | Allow up to 24 hours after admin force-install |
| Two add-on icons in sidebar | Both test and production deployments active | Remove test deployment from Apps Script → Manage deployments |
